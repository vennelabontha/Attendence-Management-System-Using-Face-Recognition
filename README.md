# Attendance-Management-System-Using-Face-Recognition

# Problem Stastatement:
          To Develop an automated attendence management system using face recognition technology.
          The systemaimsto reduce manual errors,improve attendance accuracy,and ensure the authority of student/staff
          attendence in classrooms or workplaces

#Proposed Solution:
      ->Data Collectionand Preprocessing
      ->Feature Engineering
      ->Model Selection
      ->Model Training
      ->Evaluation
      ->Deployment
      
#Software Required
  * Python Installed
  * Required Libraries: tinker,tensorflow(or PyTorch),opencv-python,pillow and numpy.

#Applications
